🧮 Arithmetic Calculator
💡 About the Project

This project was made by a 17-year-old self-taught student who wanted to turn curiosity into something real.
It started as a simple Python idea — a calculator that goes beyond numbers.
It’s about learning, experimenting, and showing that growth begins with small steps.

🎯 What It Does

Finds prime numbers

Lists divisors of any number

Calculates GCD and LCM

Gives quotient and remainder
Each feature was coded with focus and patience to help beginners understand logic, loops, and problem-solving.

🌱 Purpose

This project isn’t made for grades or money — it’s made to inspire other students to start something of their own.
Even with limited resources, you can build things that matter.

⚙️ How to Use
